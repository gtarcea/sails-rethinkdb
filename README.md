This is a fork and rename of github.com/jmdobry/waterline-rethinkdb. The original version stopped working with RethinkDB due to a dependency on older versions of the rethinkdb client
and minor rethinkdb client API changes. This version is passing most tests (fails 6 tests). I will be porting this version to use rethinkdbdash as its client library and building in
support for the waterline query language.

I would like to thank jmdobry for creating the original version and giving me an excellent starting point!
